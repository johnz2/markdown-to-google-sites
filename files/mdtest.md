# Changelog

Initially, the engine changelog is grouped into major releases but if since we
are to work on the `master` branch at the same time, we may have to use ongoing
changelogs to communicate API change going forward.

This changelog is formatted with [Markdown][markdown-syntax] and line lengths
shouldn't extend past 80 characters to allow for easy reading in the terminal
and in GitX's commit history.
